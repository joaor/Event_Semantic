    <content><![CDATA[Destruction are a German thrash metal band formed in Lörrach, Germany in 1982. They are considered one of the &quot;three kings&quot; of the Teutonic thrash metal scene; the others being <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Kreator" class="bbcode_artist">Kreator</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Sodom" class="bbcode_artist">Sodom</a>. They were first known as Knight Of Demon with the original line-up being vocalist and bassist Marcel &quot;Schmier&quot; Schirmer, drummer Tommy Sandmann, and guitarist Mike Sifinger. They changed their name to Destruction in 1984 and released a demo titled &quot;Bestial Invasion of Hell&quot;. After this, the group signed with Steamhammer Records and released an EP titled &quot;Sentence Of Death&quot; later that year.  Destruction released their first full-length album titled &quot;Infernal Overkill&quot; in 1985, followed by &quot;Eternal Devastation&quot; in 1986. The trio then added a second guitarist, Harry Wilkens and released the EP &quot;Mad Butcher in 1987, followed by the full length album &quot;Release from Agony&quot; in 1988, then a live recording &quot;Live Without Sense&quot; in 1989 and &quot;Cracked Brain&quot; in 1990. In 1989, Schmier was asked to leave the band due to creative differences and the group underwent a period of commercial deterioration. During the grunge explosion during the early to mid 1990s, the band lost their record label support and had to self-release and produce their own albums. The result was two EPs called &quot;Destruction&quot; in 1994 and &quot;Them Not Me&quot; in 1995 along with their only 1990's release called &quot;The Least Successful Human Cannonball&quot; in 1998.  In 1999, Schmier rejoined and things began to look up for the band as they signed a record deal with Nuclear Blast. They then released three more albums; &quot;All Hell Breaks Loose&quot; in 2000, &quot;The Antichrist&quot; in 2001, and &quot;Metal Discharge&quot; in 2003. The band would then sign with AFM Records and release &quot;Inventor of Evil&quot; in 2005. The band's next album, &quot;D.E.V.O.L.U.T.I.O.N.&quot;, was released in August 2008. In early 2009 Destruction is scheduled to tour around North America. Currently, the band is in the studio recording their new upcoming album called &quot;Day Of Reckoning&quot; which is due for release in January 2011 via Nuclear Blast records.
