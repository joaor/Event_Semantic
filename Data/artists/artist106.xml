    <content><![CDATA[<strong>The Divine Comedy</strong> is a baroque pop band now based in Dublin, Ireland, fronted by Neil Hannon.  Neil Hannon, Originally from Derry, has been the only ever-present member of the band, being its founder in 1989 when he was joined by John McCullagh and Kevin Traynor. Their first album, the heavily <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/R.E.M." class="bbcode_artist">R.E.M.</a>-influenced and now-deleted <em><a title="The Divine Comedy - Fanfare for the Comic Muse" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Divine+Comedy/Fanfare+for+the+Comic+Muse" class="bbcode_album">Fanfare for the Comic Muse</a></em>, enjoyed little success though. A couple of equally unsuccessful EPs - <em><a title="The Divine Comedy - Timewatch" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Divine+Comedy/Timewatch" class="bbcode_album">Timewatch</a></em> (1991); <em><a title="The Divine Comedy - Europop" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Divine+Comedy/Europop" class="bbcode_album">Europop</a></em> (1992) - were to follow, with newly-recruited member John Allen handling lead vocals on some tracks. After the commercial failure of the latter EP, this line-up soon fell apart.  Hannon, however, was not deterred in his efforts and re-appeared in 1993 with <em><a title="The Divine Comedy - Liberation" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Divine+Comedy/Liberation" class="bbcode_album">Liberation</a></em>. Featuring a fairly diverse musical outlook that goes from the tongue-in-cheek synth pop of <a title="The Divine Comedy &ndash; Europop" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Divine+Comedy/_/Europop" class="bbcode_track">Europop</a>(nearly unrecognisable from the previously-released version) to the classical stylings of <a title="The Divine Comedy &ndash; Timewatching" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Divine+Comedy/_/Timewatching" class="bbcode_track">Timewatching</a>.  Indeed, it was only some minor success in France that really enabled Hannon to proceed to his second effort <em><a title="The Divine Comedy - Promenade" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Divine+Comedy/Promenade" class="bbcode_album">Promenade</a></em>. Released in 1994, this was heavily driven by classical influences, with Michael Nyman's stylings clearly an influence. Hannon himself acknowledged this when he apparently sent a copy of his new album to the composer, jokingly asking him not to sue. Essentially a concept album about a day spent by two lovers, it also received similar critical acclaim to that which <em><a title="The Divine Comedy - Liberation" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Divine+Comedy/Liberation" class="bbcode_album">Liberation</a></em> was afforded. Commercial success, though, was not forthcoming.  At around the same time, Hannon also wrote and performed the theme music for the TV sitcom Father Ted (which would subsequently be incorporated into the song <a title="The Divine Comedy &ndash; Songs of Love" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Divine+Comedy/_/Songs+of+Love" class="bbcode_track">Songs of Love</a> on the album <em><a title="The Divine Comedy - Casanova" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Divine+Comedy/Casanova" class="bbcode_album">Casanova</a></em>), and later wrote the music for the deliberately bad mock-Eurovision song <a title="The Divine Comedy &ndash; My Lovely Horse" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Divine+Comedy/_/My+Lovely+Horse" class="bbcode_track">My Lovely Horse</a> for one episode. Hannon resisted widespread requests from fans to release the track as a single for the Christmas market, but it was eventually released in 1999 as the third track on the CD-single <em><a title="The Divine Comedy - Gin Soaked Boy" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Divine+Comedy/Gin+Soaked+Boy" class="bbcode_album">Gin Soaked Boy</a></em>. This would not be the only time they would be responsible for a TV theme, as <a title="The Divine Comedy &ndash; In Pursuit of Happiness" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Divine+Comedy/_/In+Pursuit+of+Happiness" class="bbcode_track">In Pursuit of Happiness</a> was also used by the BBC science and technology show, Tomorrow's World. Hannon also recently composed the music for the comedy series &quot;The IT Crowd&quot;.  The album <em><a title="The Divine Comedy - Casanova" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Divine+Comedy/Casanova" class="bbcode_album">Casanova</a></em> (1996), and in particular the single <a title="The Divine Comedy &ndash; Something for the Weekend" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Divine+Comedy/_/Something+for+the+Weekend" class="bbcode_track">Something for the Weekend</a> led to the band's first major successes, with Neil Hannon becoming a distinctive, albeit unlikely, popstar in an immaculate suit, and always appearing the elegant dandy. At the height of their commercial success, the band put out <em><a title="The Divine Comedy - A Short Album About Love" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Divine+Comedy/A+Short+Album+About+Love" class="bbcode_album">A Short Album About Love</a></em> (a reference to the Krzysztof Kieślowski movie A Short Film About Love), recorded live at soundcheck with the Brunel Ensemble in preparation for a concert at the Shepherd's Bush Empire, from which several songs were released as b-sides. It was aptly released on Valentine's Day in 1997. Subsequently, the band contributed a reworking of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Noel+Coward" class="bbcode_artist">Noel Coward</a>'s <a title="The Divine Comedy &ndash; I've Been to a Marvellous Party" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Divine+Comedy/_/I%27ve+Been+to+a+Marvellous+Party" class="bbcode_track">I've Been to a Marvellous Party</a> to a compilation of covers of the writer's songs, with Hannon affecting a Cowardesque lilt (albeit interspersed with an aggressive electronic musical backing).  The foppish image, but not the suit, was ditched for the more sombre album <em><a title="The Divine Comedy - Fin de Si&egrave;cle" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Divine+Comedy/Fin+de+Si%C3%A8cle" class="bbcode_album">Fin de Si&egrave;cle</a></em> in 1998, although its biggest hit, the jaunty <a title="The Divine Comedy &ndash; National Express" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Divine+Comedy/_/National+Express" class="bbcode_track">National Express</a>, a song about the national coach operators, belied its more intimate, soul-searching tone. Maintaining the balance between these poles, 1999's <em><a title="The Divine Comedy - Secret History - The Best of The Divine Comedy" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Divine+Comedy/Secret+History+-+The+Best+of+The+Divine+Comedy" class="bbcode_album">Secret History - The Best of The Divine Comedy</a></em> included a re-recording of <em><a title="The Divine Comedy - Liberation" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Divine+Comedy/Liberation" class="bbcode_album">Liberation</a></em> track <a title="The Divine Comedy &ndash; The Pop Singer's Fear of the Pollen Count" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Divine+Comedy/_/The+Pop+Singer%27s+Fear+of+the+Pollen+Count" class="bbcode_track">The Pop Singer's Fear of the Pollen Count</a> and two new songs (<a title="The Divine Comedy &ndash; Gin-Soaked Boy" href="http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/The+Divine+Comedy/_/Gin-Soaked+Boy" class="bbcode_track">Gin-Soaked Boy</a> and <a title="The Divine Comedy &ndash; Too Young To Die" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Divine+Comedy/_/Too+Young+To+Die" class="bbcode_track">Too Young To Die</a>) alongside the band's main hits. In the same year, the band also collaborated with <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Jones" class="bbcode_artist">Tom Jones</a> on a cover version of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Portishead" class="bbcode_artist">Portishead</a>'s <a title="Tom Jones &ndash; All Mine" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Jones/_/All+Mine" class="bbcode_track">All Mine</a>, featured on his album <em><a title="Tom Jones - Reload" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Jones/Reload" class="bbcode_album">Reload</a></em>.  A serious side to the band was also in evidence in 2000's collaboration with <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Ute+Lemper" class="bbcode_artist">Ute Lemper</a> on her album <em><a title="Ute Lemper - Punishing Kiss" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Ute+Lemper/Punishing+Kiss" class="bbcode_album">Punishing Kiss</a></em>, most of which featured The Divine Comedy as Lemper's backing band.  The 2001 album <em><a title="The Divine Comedy - Regeneration" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Divine+Comedy/Regeneration" class="bbcode_album">Regeneration</a></em> attempted to remove the band still further from its association with comedy. Hannon hired famous producer Nigel Godrich to &quot;remake&quot; the band. Neil ditched the suit and donned the Britrock band image. However, the album was a greater critical than commercial success, and soon after its release it was announced that The Divine Comedy were splitting up. However within a year Hannon was touring again with a revised band line-up, playing a series of joint-headline gigs in the USA, UK and Ireland featuring both The Divine Comedy and Ben Folds, who would cover The Divine Comedy's <a title="Ben Folds &ndash; Songs of Love" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Ben+Folds/_/Songs+of+Love" class="bbcode_track">Songs of Love</a> on his <em><a title="Ben Folds - Sunny 16" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Ben+Folds/Sunny+16" class="bbcode_album">Sunny 16</a></em> EP.  Eventually a new album surfaced in the form of 2004's <em><a title="The Divine Comedy - Absent Friends" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Divine+Comedy/Absent+Friends" class="bbcode_album">Absent Friends</a></em>. Striking a balance between the occasionally earnest sound of the band's later material and the lighter tone of the more popular releases, it encapsulated the essence of The Divine Comedy. 2004 saw two dates of particularly acclaimed performances, one at the London Palladium (which was later released as a live DVD) and one at the Royal Albert Hall.  In January 2005, Hannon announced that he had acquired the worldwide copyrights to all of his recorded output with his former record label, Setanta Records. He declared on the band's official website that he would be launching his own record label Divine Comedy Records in order to re-release his 1990s output.  Hannon's ninth album under the Divine Comedy moniker, <em><a title="The Divine Comedy - Victory For The Comic Muse" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Divine+Comedy/Victory+For+The+Comic+Muse" class="bbcode_album">Victory For The Comic Muse</a></em> (a reference to his debut), was released in June 2006. It is suggested by fans to be less personal and more free-approach in tone than his most recent albums. The bulk of the record was recorded in just two weeks, hence the more spontaneous sound, and features appearances from <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Travis" class="bbcode_artist">Travis</a> bass player Dougie Payne.  Hannon collaborated with Thomas Walsh of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Pugwash" class="bbcode_artist">Pugwash</a> to create an album themed around the sport of cricket. Released under the alias <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Duckworth+Lewis+Method" class="bbcode_artist">The Duckworth Lewis Method</a>, the self-titled album was released in 2009 to critical acclaim.  The following year saw the tenth Divine Comedy album and first on his own label, <em><a title="The Divine Comedy - Bang Goes The Knighthood" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Divine+Comedy/Bang+Goes+The+Knighthood" class="bbcode_album">Bang Goes The Knighthood</a></em>.
